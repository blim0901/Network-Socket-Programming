# Network-Socket-Programming
For the first part, I experimented with client/server socket programming, which is widely practised in the industries. Java programming language was used to introduce the typical APIs available at the transport layer. The java.net package provides the socket mechanism for applications to communicate via a network. In the TCP/IP protocol suite, there are two services provided at the transport layer, viz. the connection-oriented TCP service, and the connectionless UDP service. A copy of RFC 865 was obtained from http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html .  In the second part, I wrote python codes to do basic analysis of network data log. I deciphered the network traffic data captured that was stored as Microsoft Excel file (.csv). From the raw data, I managed to get important information such as Top 5 Talkers, (ie sender nodes) Top 5 Listeners (ie receiving node), Top 5 applications, Total traffic, Proportion of TCP and UDP packets, Top 5 communication pair, Graphical visualization of the communication between different IP hosts.
